    "- __Loops__: Loops are another cornerstone of programming and allow programmers to repeat steps multiple times until some condition is met or the condition has reached the pre-specified number of iterations \n",
    "- The condition in a loop is important as it determines how long the loop will run for \n",
    "- After each __[iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration)__, the loop checks the condition. If the condition tells the loop to continue, another iteration will commence. If the condition tells the loop to stop, the loop will end. \n",
    "- For example, if you wanted to print \"Hello World\" 10 times, you can easily write 10 statements that look like this: `print(\"Hello World\")`, but this would not be the most efficient way of performing this task\n",
    "- Instead, you can leverage a loop to repeat the statement `print(\"Hello World\")` by enclosing the statemenet in a loop and telling the loop to repeat this task 10 times \n",
    "\n",
    "__Helpful Points:__\n",
    "1. Any time you find yourself having to repeat a step more than once, you should consider using a loop\n",

    "- The [`itertools`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html) suite of functions allows us to perform advanced iteration in an efficient manner\n",
    "- The `itertools` suite does not come built-into Python, so we have to \"load\" in the suite of functions using an `import` command (explained later)\n",
    "- The function implements a number of `iterators` for our use \n",
    "- The `iterators` can be broken down into 3 categories:\n",
    "> 1. __Infinite Iterators__ (`count()`, `cycle()`, `repeat()`). Infinite iterators refer to iterators that when you use them, you will need to manually exit them using a `break` statement, otherwise you will end up in an __infinite loop__ \n",
    "> 2. __Finite Iterators__ (`accumulate()`, `groupby()`, `chain()`, `islice()`, etc.) Finite iterators refer to iterators that when you use them, you will not need to manually exit them using a `break` statement. They will terminate on the shortest input sequence\n",
    "> 3. __Combinatoric Iterators__ (`combinations()`, `permutations()`, etc.) \n",
    "\n",

    "1. These tools are intended for advanced iteration so ensure you understand the basic concepts of loops first \n",
