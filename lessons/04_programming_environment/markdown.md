# [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)  

## Objective
- It is relevant to learn Markdown so the pre-work can be submitted in an easy-to-read format.  
- During the bootcamp, you will create a blog on an open source tool and the blogs will be written in Markdown
- Furthermore, markdown will serve as a great starting point to learning [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) which is used to make gorgeous documents used in academic publications. If you aren't interested in LaTeX, knowledge of markdown will also prepare you to use software like [Typora](https://typora.io/) - which fuses markdown with LaTeX and other writing packages.

## Instructions
Read this document and use the Markdown syntax to write up your pre-work solutions.

## Deliverable
Markdown syntax will be seen in subsequent pre-work file submissions.

Typora is a fantastic free software that renders your markdown in realtime as you type. You can also write markdown in any text editor and preview it on github.

**Important:**  Look at your rendered markdown file before submitting!  :boom:

## Introduction
### [What Is Markdown? 4 Reasons Why You Should Learn It Now](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/markdown-4-reasons-learn-now/)  
Markdown is a simple way to add formatting — like headers, bold/italic text, and lists — to plain text. Rather than relying on HTML or [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editors, Markdown allows you to create full pages of formatted text without ever having to remove your fingers from the keyboard, and all in a way that’s much more intuitive than HTML.
