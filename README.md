## Welcome to Beginner Python and Math for Data Science!
---
This repository contains course material for the live online **Beginner Python and Math for Data Science (BPM) course**. It is 
also serves as the repository of **pre-work** material for students enrolled in a **Metis bootcamp**.  If you already took the **Beginner Python and Math for Data Science course** and completed the Hackerrank assessments, you have already fulfilled the **pre-work** requirement.

# Before the Course Begins

Refer to the [Metis Fundamentals Repo](https://github.com/thisismetis/NBM_Metis_Fundamentals) 
to complete the following setup steps: 
1. Download a local copy of this GitHub repo, following [these steps](https://github.com/thisismetis/NBM_Metis_Fundamentals/tree/main/git_and_github)
2. Install [**anaconda** (required) and the **metis environment** (recommended)](https://github.com/thisismetis/NBM_Metis_Fundamentals/tree/main/anaconda_and_metis_env); 
confirm your installation by successfully running through the accompanying [practice jupyter notebook](https://github.com/thisismetis/NBM_Metis_Fundamentals/blob/main/anaconda_and_metis_env/anaconda_installation/practice_nb.ipynb)

# Course Structure and Components
#### Lessons
The first half of the course will cover the basics of programming with Python, and then progress to more advanced topics 
and libraries such as Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib. The second half of the course covers the fundamentals of 
Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability and Statistics.
See [Course Schedule](#course-schedule) below for lesson details and links.

#### Additional Material
Most lessons will have a set of additional accompanying materials which go into more detail about the lesson topic.
We recommend that you read through this material on your own, especially if you are working through this material 
independently (as Bootcamp Pre-work) rather than taking the BPM Live Online course.

#### Homework 
Most lessons will have a set of homework problems and solutions.  Try to work through the problems on your own (it is okay to 
discuss with your peers and instructors), and then review the solutions.  The homework problems are not graded and do not 
need to be submitted.

#### HackerRank assessments
The Course Schedule also contains five HackerRank assessments that check for understanding of the content that has been
covered. We strongly recommend that you work through these assessments as you progress through the course. Each assessment
should take around 2 hours to complete.

### Repo Issues

At Metis, we aim to keep our course content as error-free and seamlessly functional as possible, frequently reviewing and refining it. While we expect that you will find few issues when navigating and using our course repos (either on GitHub or locally), we know we're not perfect. If you encounter issues, it can help you, your peers, future students, and us if you let us know about them by using this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSde-RqyXVR-UXvMbhZSp068__rw--36hrLGPsqtp-XJUDWh5g/viewform?usp=sf_link).
